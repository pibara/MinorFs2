MinorFs2
========

Version 2 of MinorFs is currently in its early development stages.  

The MinorFs2 project aims to make the concepts introduced with the proof-of-concept MinorFs 
project into a somewhat less pure but more practical implementation. 

MinorFs2 will be written from scratch in C++ without re-use of the old MinorFs perl code. 
An earlier attempt to use Python has been abandoned and any Python code remaining in this 
repository shall be removed as soon as all the usefull parts have been ported to C++.

The base setup and goals for MinorFs2 are described [here](http://minorfs.polacanthus.net/wiki/MinorFs2).
