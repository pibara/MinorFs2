Version 2 of MinorFs is currently in its design phase. The MinorFs2 project aims to make the concepts introduced with the proof-of-concept MinorFs project into a somewhat less pure but more practical implementation. MinorFs2 will be written from scratch in Python without re-use of the old MinorFs perl code. 

There is no code here yet, Please check back later.
